If you are on Windows, you may install Vim as standalone program, or I would recommend you to download a package of tools that comes with Vim from https://git-scm.com/download/win. This GitBash for Windows will comes with a "Linux Terminal Simulator" called MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), and with it, comes with a Bash shell that let you manipulate Terminal with many of Linux commond commands. One of such command is actually "vim"! You may run above verification commands to ensure vim is installed properly.


Here is the Git Bash look like on Windows (NOTE: It did not open the vim program here on screenshot, but that's how the Bash shell looks like in Windows. Just type `vim` to get started.)
